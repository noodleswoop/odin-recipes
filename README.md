i tried to push this README, my index page, the recipe directory, and the image directory to github. according to the command line all went well, but the files are not showing up on github?? what gives man

ok whatever i'm going to make 2 more recipe pages and hope that my stuff makes it into my github repository sometime before i'm done. :/

woohoo just finished the mac and cheese page. forgot to add the steps heading haha. gonna go ahead and push the updated readme, index page, chickenskillet (i added a back to home link - not in official project description), and new mac and cheese page + image to github.
just checked github. still hasn't upload. what the shit m8

17:56
checked github again. still nothing??
made the mojito recipe for my last since i'm tired of typing haha. updated the index page. hokay. let's push the last of this to github.

anyway this was a fun exercise in pages. i already knew a lot of the elements + how to work an absolute link but i didn't really know how to work with relative links. this helped loads. web dev is fun!
