hokay so this is where i'm writing my reflections on this project

i tried to push this README, my index page, the recipe directory, and the image directory to github. according to the command line all went well, but the files are not showing up on github?? what gives man

ok whatever i'm going to make 2 more recipe pages and hope that my stuff makes it into my github repository sometime before i'm done. :/
